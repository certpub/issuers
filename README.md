# CertPub Issuers

This repository tracks and publishes the root and intermediate certificates for certifiicates used in CertPub services.

Please see the [releases](https://github.com/certpub/issuers/releases) to find the current key stores.

Each CertPub environment (`test` and `production`) is made available as PEM listing (`.pem`), PKCS#12 (`.p12`) and Java Key Store (`.jks`) for use in different software environments.

Please make sure to watch (`Release only` should be enough) this repository to stay up to date on updates.
